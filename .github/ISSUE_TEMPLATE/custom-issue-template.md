Hi, before posting an issue please try to replicate your bug in an empty repo and push it up to be available publicly.

Here are some repos that you can fork and attempt to replicate the issue:

- https://github.com/XeroAPI/xero-node-samples
- Copy and paste the examples in the README or this repo

This will help us to diagnose your issue.

Any bugs/issues with the API are best directed to: https://developer.xero.com/community

Often the best place for documentation is the integration tests in this repo. Please have a look:

- [Integration tests](src/__integration_tests__)
- [Sample app](https://github.com/XeroAPI/xero-node-sample-app)

Thanks
